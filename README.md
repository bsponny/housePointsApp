# House Points App

## Overview
This is an Android Application to keep track of Hogwarts House Points. You use it by clicking on the House you wish to add/subtract points for, then click on the button to either add or subtract 10 or 5 points. This will then update the screen to show you how many points each house has.

## TODO:
* Create a database to store the point information! It deletes as soon as you close the app
